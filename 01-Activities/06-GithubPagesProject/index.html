        <h2>Cool Facts About Sloths as Found on the World Animal Protetion Website</h2>
        
        <h3>#1</h3>
        <p>There are two types of slothes. They can be differentiated by the number of claws on their front limbs.</p>
        
        <h3>#2</h3>
        <p>Presently, slothes are about the size of a medium-sized dog. Historically, slothes used to be as large as an Asian elephant. The mega-sloths became an extinct species around 10,000 years ago.</p>

        <h3>#3</h3>
        <p>Sloths posses a natural camouflage representing a symbiotic relationship with the algae that grows on their fur. The sloth provides the shelter and water necessary for the algae to develop on the surface, and the algae provides a natural protective layer of camouflage on the sloth. The algae also provides additional nutrients through the skin.</p>
